Notable exceptions were Optionals and the way Protocols and Extensions are used in Swift</p><h2>Starting SwiftUI</h2><p>While I learned a bit of iOS programming as a hobby, that was mostly centered on UIKit, so the section was the first time I really learned more about SwiftUI, the main focus was on learning basic view types like <strong>Stacks</strong>, <strong>NavigationView</strong>, <strong>Forms</strong> and how to make use of the concept that views are a function of their state.</p><p>Other important aspects were how to use <strong>buttons</strong>, showing <strong>alerts</strong>. In the technique project I learned more about how views and viewmodifiers work under the hood, why structs are used for most things and why 'some View' is used so much</p><h2>Expanding your skills</h2><p>After the first section I was able to easily create basic UI's and now this section focused on expanding my knowledge of all the views SwiftUI offers, in this section I learned about <strong>Stepper</strong>, <strong>DatePicker</strong> and <strong>List</strong> views, got to know a bit of machine learning with <strong>Create ML</strong> and learned how to work with dates in Swift.</p><p>Additionally I got more practice with <strong>@State</strong>, <strong>Alert</strong> and <strong>NavigationView</strong> and also learned how to load resources from the bundle, in the technique project I learned about animations and how easy it can be to animate changes in state</p><h2>Scaling up to bigger apps</h2><p>After the last two sections I was able to create simple apps that can do simple things in a short time, now this chapter focused on the things that are needed to create bigger apps, amongst other things a new form of sharing state with <strong>@ObservedObject</strong>, how to show/hide views, delete items from lists, storing user settings and archiving objects.</p><p>I also got more in-depth knowledge of why <strong>@State</strong> only works with structs, how to work with hierachical Codable data and how to push views on the navigation stack and learned about <strong>GeometryReader</strong>, <strong>ScrollView</strong> and how to create custom <strong>Paths</strong> and <strong>Shapes</strong> in SwiftUI.</p><h2>Focus on data</h2><p>The focus of this section, like the title says, was on data, sending and receiving it, and using <strong>Core Data</strong> with SwiftUI, here I learned how to add <strong>Codable</strong> conformance to <strong>@Published</strong> properties, using <strong>URLSession</strong> to receive and send data, about <strong>@FetchRequest</strong>, how to sort and filter those requests and how to delete data, how to create custom <strong>NSManagedObject</strong> subclasses, using constraints and relationships.</p><p>Additionally I practiced using more custom components, size classes and type erasure</p><h2>Views and View controllers</h2><p>After getting a grasp on how to handle data, the focus went back to views and their controllers, in this section I learned about custom bindings, <strong>ActionSheet</strong>, wrapping <strong>UIViewController</strong> in SwiftUI views and using <strong>coordinators</strong> to manage them, how to save and import images from the photo library and filter them with <strong>Core Image</strong>, adding <strong>Comparable</strong> to custom types, writing to the documents directory, switching view states with enums, using <strong>MapKit</strong>, Touch/Face ID and extending existing types to support <strong>ObservableObject</strong>.</p><p>In the technique project I learned about accessibility, how to identify views, hide and group accessibility data and reading the value of controls</p><h2>Controlling UI Flow</h2><p>The more views there are, the more need for a good UI flow there is, this section taught me how to create and use <strong>TabViews</strong>, using <strong>@EnvironmentObject</strong>, adding <strong>context menus</strong>, scheduling notifications and adding package dependencies, understanding how the <strong>Result</strong> type works, how to manually push <strong>ObservableObject</strong> changes, dynamically filtering a list, using <strong>gestures</strong> and haptic feedback with <strong>Core Haptics</strong>.</p><p>Furthermore I learned about disabling user interactiviy, <strong>Timers</strong>, getting notified when the app changes to back-/foreground and how to support specific accessibility needs.</p><p>For the technique project I learned how layout works in SwiftUI, how to use and create alignment guides and how GeometryReader works and can be used to easily create nice effects.</p><h2>One last project</h2><p>For the last project the focus was on creating an app the specifically works well on iPads, for this I learned using <strong>NavigationView</strong> with two views, using <strong>Alerts</strong> and <strong>Sheets</strong> with optionals and using <strong>Groups</strong> as transparent layout containers.</p><p>One thing that stood out to me was the last wrap up challenge of adding sorting and filtering to the list which sounded intimidating at first, but was surprisingly easy to code in a <strong>swifty</strong> way.</p><h1>Day 100: Final Exam</h1><p><a href="/certificate.jpg">Certificate</a></p></div><span>Tagged with:
